# Poker Game Simulator

## How to start the game

- Clone this github repository
- Run Main.java

## Game overview

- You will be prompted to enter the number of players (Up to a maximum of 10 due to the 52 card limit)
- You will then be asked to enter the name for each player
- Finally your program will run
- On the CLI, you will be given the game results, including the rankings of the players, details of the card assign to each player, and the most valuable card ( which will be tie-breaking in case of identical hand ranks found)

## Assumption

- Me personally haven't played poker at all so the information about value of the Suit I got from the internet. Here is what I assume from highest to lowest: Spade, Heart, Diamond, Club.
